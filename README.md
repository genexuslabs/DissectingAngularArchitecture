# Introduction

This repository is the base to understand why generated GeneXus Angular applications are high quality applications in terms of performance, consistency, maintainability and integration.

# Design Decisions

- The generator will allow the coexistence of generated code with manually written code.
- The generator will always be using the latest Angular and Typescript versions.
- Choose and mantain references to the best modules out there.
- Cross platform Node Scripts.
- Cross Framework Standard Classes to be shared between different Front-end generators (https://github.com/genexuslabs/web-standard-functions)
- Cross Framework UI Controls te be shared between different Front-end generators (https://github.com/genexuslabs/web-controls-library)
- 3 tier client generation (UI, Behavior, Data Connectors)

# Current Power of the Generator

The Angular generator is a front-end generator. The generated objects run on the browser and communicate with the back-end on the server to get and send information.

The back-end is not generated by the Angular generator; instead, it is generated by one of the existing GeneXus generators, such as the Java, .Net or .NetCore generator. 

# Generated Source Code

Every GeneXus object is generated in a separate directory, where all the sources are grouped. This is under the <Model directory>\mobile\Angular\<main>\src\apps folder.
